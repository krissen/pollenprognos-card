# Contributing to Polleninformation EU

First of all, **thank you for considering contributing to this project!**  
Everyone is welcome to participate, regardless of experience level, background, or where you are from.

We appreciate all kinds of contributions, including code, documentation, translations, bug reports, feature requests, and ideas for improvements.

## How to Contribute

- **Fork** the repository and create your own feature branch from the latest `master`.
- **Do _not_ create pull requests (PRs) directly against `master`.**
  - Instead, open your PR against a development or feature branch (e.g., `dev`, or your own feature branch).
  - Pull requests targeting `master` will be closed.
- **Describe your changes clearly** in your pull request. Include motivation and context where helpful.
- **Follow the existing code style** and try to keep your changes focused (one thing per PR).
- If you’re unsure about your change or want feedback before implementing, feel free to [open an issue](../../issues/new) for discussion.

## Reporting Issues

- If you find a bug or have an idea for an enhancement, please [open an issue](../../issues/new) and describe it as clearly as possible.
- Include steps to reproduce, screenshots, logs, or any context that may help us understand and address the issue.
