# Kleenex Pollen Radar API Testing Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive testing suite for discovering all possible allergens from the Kleenex Pollen Radar API across different geographic regions.

## ⚠️ Network Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: These testing scripts require internet access to external Kleenex API endpoints:
- www.kleenex.co.uk (United Kingdom)
- www.kleenex.fr (France) 
- www.kleenex.nl (Netherlands)
- www.kleenex.com (United States)
- www.it.scottex.com (Italy)

The scripts will not work in restricted network environments where external domains are blocked. If you encounter DNS resolution errors like "No address associated with hostname", this indicates that your network environment blocks external API access.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Kleenex integration in pollenprognos-card supports multiple allergens, but the exact set of allergens available depends on geographic location and season. This testing suite systematically explores the API to discover:

- All possible individual allergens across different regions
- Regional variations in allergen availability  
- Frequency and priority of newly discovered allergens
- Implementation recommendations for expanding card support

### Output Files (Generated)

**`kleenex_allergen_test_data.json`** - Raw test data
- Hierarchical structure: region → location → allergens → details
- Includes geographic coordinates, timestamps, allergen values/levels
- Appends to existing data when script is re-run

**`kleenex_allergen_test_data_analysis.json`** - Analysis results
- Coverage analysis (new vs supported allergens)
- Regional breakdown and allergen-specific statistics  
- Priority-ranked recommendations for implementation

**`kleenex_quick_test_results.json`** - Quick test results
- Summary of quick validation test
- List of allergens found in major cities

## 🚀 Usage

### Prerequisites

Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4
```

### Quick Test (2-3 minutes)

Verify API integration with a few strategic locations:
```bash
cd scripts/
python3 kleenex_quick_test.py
```

### Full Discovery Test (20-45 minutes)

Comprehensive allergen discovery across all regions:
```bash
cd scripts/
python3 kleenex_allergen_tester.py
```

### Analysis

Process test data to identify implementation opportunities:
```bash
cd scripts/
python3 kleenex_allergen_analyzer.py
```

## 🌍 Tested Regions

The suite tests these geographic regions with the following call frequencies:

| Region | Code | Calls | Rationale |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| France | FR | 5 | Smaller European region |
| Italy | IT | 5 | Smaller European region |
| Netherlands | NL | 5 | Smallest region |
| United Kingdom | UK | 10 | Larger European region |
| United States | US | 10 | Largest region |

**Total API calls:** 35 per full test run
**Estimated runtime:** 20-45 minutes (with courtesy delays)

## 🎲 Random Coordinate Generation

Each test run generates fresh random coordinates within precise geographic boundaries:

- **France:** 41.3°N-51.1°N, 5.1°W-9.6°E
- **Italy:** 35.5°N-47.1°N, 6.6°E-18.5°E  
- **Netherlands:** 50.8°N-53.6°N, 3.4°E-7.2°E
- **United Kingdom:** 49.9°N-60.8°N, 10.7°W-1.8°E
- **United States:** 24.4°N-49.4°N, 125.0°W-66.9°W

Coordinates are rounded to 4 decimal places (~11m precision) for realistic location testing.

## 📊 Expected Discoveries

Based on Kleenex documentation and European/North American flora, the testing may discover these additional allergens:

### Trees
- ash, beech, willow, lime, chestnut, walnut, maple, cedar

### Weeds  
- nettle, plantain, chenopod, dock

### Grass Types
- poaceae, timothy, bermuda, rye grass

### Regional Variations
Different regions may have unique allergens not found elsewhere, particularly:
- Mediterranean species (Italy, Southern France)
- Northern European species (Netherlands, UK) 
- North American species (US)

## ⚠️ API Courtesy

The testing suite implements several courtesy measures:

- **Random delays:** 3-12 seconds between API calls
- **Reasonable request volume:** Maximum 35 calls per full test
- **Standard User-Agent:** Uses common browser identification
- **Error handling:** Graceful failure handling without retry storms
- **Appending data:** Re-runs append to existing data rather than duplicating calls

## 📈 Analysis Output

The analyzer provides:

### Priority Rankings
Allergens ranked by implementation priority based on:
- Frequency of appearance across tests
- Regional coverage (how many regions have it)
- Value ranges (higher values = more medically significant)
- Level ranges (higher levels = more severe reactions)

### Implementation Recommendations
- **High Priority:** Allergens found frequently across multiple regions
- **Medium Priority:** Regionally common allergens  
- **Low Priority:** Rare or region-specific allergens

### Regional Analysis
- Which allergens are specific to certain regions
- Coverage gaps in current implementation
- Frequency statistics for decision making

## 🔧 Integration with pollenprognos-card

Test results directly inform expansion of the card's allergen support:

1. **`src/constants.js`** - Add new allergens to `ALLERGEN_TRANSLATION`
2. **`src/locales/en.json`** - Add English translations for new allergens  
3. **`src/adapters/kleenex.js`** - Update allergen detection patterns if needed
4. **`src/pollenprognos-svgs.js`** - Add SVG icons for new allergens

The analyzer output provides specific recommendations for which allergens to prioritize based on real-world API data.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Network Issues
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify Kleenex website accessibility  
- Try the quick test first to isolate issues

### API Changes
- Kleenex may update their API structure
- HTML parsing patterns may need updates
- Check browser dev tools for current API format

### Data Issues
- Empty results may indicate API blocking or rate limiting
- Try reducing call frequency or changing User-Agent
- Check output JSON for parsing errors in raw_details
